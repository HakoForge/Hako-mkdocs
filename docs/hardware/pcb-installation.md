# PCB Installation

## Overview

PCB installation is a critical step in setting up your Hako-Core or Mini chassis. This guide covers the proper mounting procedures for all backplane types and ensures secure, reliable connections.

Each PCB in the Hako-Core system provides power regulation and data connectivity for a specific set of drives. Proper installation ensures optimal performance and system reliability.

### PCB Types

The Hako-Core and Hako-Core Mini supports several PCB configurations:

- **12-SSD Backplane**: 2.5" drive support
- **4-HDD Backplane**: 3.5" drive support  
- **Mixed 4-Bay Backplane**: Combined 2.5" and 3.5" support

## Tool Requirements
### Basic Tools
- Phillips #2 head screwdriver (magnetic tip recommended).

### Optional Tools
- Magnetic parts tray for screw storage.
- Clean cloth for handling.
- Anti-static wrist strap
- Proper lighting for clear visibility

## Installation Procedure

!!! danger "Safety First"
    It is always recommended to power down the system when working inside the case.

### Step 1: Identify Mounting Location

Each PCB has designated mounting locations within the chassis:

1. Locate standoffs in chassis for your PCB position
2. Align PCB over the mounting standoffs in correct orientation
3. Verify all mounting holes align with standoffs
4. Secure PCB with provided screws. (Recommended to start opposite corners first)

!!! warning "Torque Specification"
    Do not over-tighten screws. PCBs can crack under excessive pressure. Tighten just until snug with no movement.


## Verification Steps

### Visual Inspection

After installation, verify:

- PCB sits level and secure
- All screws properly tightened
- No visible cable stress or interference
- Any connectors are fully seated

### Electrical Testing

Before installing drives:

1. Power on system (without drives)
2. Check PCB power LEDs if present
4. Test with single drive before full installation
