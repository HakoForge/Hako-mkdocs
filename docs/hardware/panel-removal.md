# Panel Removal

Safe and proper panel removal is essential for accessing internal components while protecting both the chassis and yourself during maintenance.

## Overview

The HakoCore chassis features a sliding lid design that provides full access to internal components. The lid removal process is designed to be simple yet secure.

### Safety First

!!! danger "Power Safety"
    **Always disconnect power** completely before removing any panels:
    
    - Turn off and unplug the power supply
    - Press the power button to discharge capacitors
    - Wait at least 30 seconds before proceeding
    - Verify no LEDs are illuminated

## Lid Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Locate and Remove the Securing Screw

![Securing Screw Location](../../assets/lid-screw-location.png)

1. **Find the screw** on the rear edge of the chassis lid
2. **Use a Phillips head screwdriver** to remove the screw
3. **Store the screw safely** - place it in a magnetic parts tray or small bowl
4. **Note the screw type** - it's a standard M3 or M4 machine screw

!!! tip "Screw Management"
    Keep track of the securing screw! It's easy to lose and essential for proper reassembly.

### Step 2: Slide the Lid Backward

1. **Grasp the lid firmly** with both hands
2. **Slide backward** approximately 1 inch (25mm)
3. **Feel for the release** - the lid should move freely once unlatched
4. **Stop when resistance is felt** - don't force the sliding motion

### Step 3: Lift and Remove

1. **Lift the rear edge** of the lid first
2. **Continue lifting** in an arc motion
3. **Clear the front lip** of the chassis
4. **Set the lid aside** in a safe location

## Safety Considerations

### Handling Precautions

- **Support the lid weight** - it's heavier than it appears
- **Watch for cables** that might be connected to the lid
- **Mind your fingers** - avoid pinch points during sliding
- **Clear your workspace** - ensure adequate space for lid placement

### Cable Management

!!! warning "Cable Awareness"
    Some configurations may have cables connected to the lid for:
    
    - Status LED indicators
    - Fan power connections
    - Temperature sensors
    
    **Disconnect these cables before full lid removal**.

## Reassembly Process

### Reversing the Steps

1. **Position the lid** over the chassis, front edge first
2. **Lower carefully** ensuring proper alignment
3. **Slide forward** until the lid seats completely
4. **Replace and tighten** the securing screw

### Verification Checklist

- ✅ Lid sits flush with chassis body
- ✅ No gaps around the perimeter
- ✅ Securing screw is tight but not over-torqued
- ✅ All cables are reconnected (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Lid won't slide** | Screw not fully removed | Double-check screw removal |
| **Binding during slide** | Internal obstruction | Check for cable interference |
| **Lid doesn't sit flush** | Misalignment | Lift and reposition properly |
| **Can't find screw** | Lost during removal | Check magnetic parts tray |

### Alignment Issues

If the lid doesn't align properly:

1. **Check for obstructions** inside the chassis
2. **Verify slide rails** are clean and undamaged
3. **Inspect lid edges** for bent or damaged areas
4. **Ensure front lip** engages properly with chassis

## Maintenance Tips

### Regular Care

- **Monthly inspection** of lid alignment
- **Clean slide rails** quarterly with dry cloth
- **Check securing screw** for proper torque
- **Lubricate if necessary** with light machine oil

### Long-term Storage

If storing the chassis with lid removed:

- **Protect internal components** from dust
- **Store lid vertically** or flat (not on edge)
- **Keep securing screw with lid** to prevent loss
- **Cover open chassis** with clean cloth

## Alternative Access Methods

### Front Panel Access

For quick access without full lid removal:

- **Magnetic front panel** can be removed easily
- **Provides access** to front fans and some cages
- **No tools required** for removal
- **Ideal for drive installation/removal**

### Partial Lid Opening

For some maintenance tasks:

- **Remove securing screw only**
- **Slide lid back partially**
- **Lift rear edge slightly** for cable access
- **Maintain some weather protection**
