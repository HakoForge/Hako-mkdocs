# Panel Removal

Safe and proper removal of chassis panels is essential for accessing internal components. The HakoCore features a slide-and-lift lid mechanism for easy maintenance access.

## Overview

The HakoCore chassis lid is designed for quick, tool-minimal removal while maintaining structural integrity when closed. The system uses a single securing screw and a slide-rail mechanism.

### Design Features

- **Single-screw retention** for simplicity
- **Slide-rail guides** prevent binding
- **Lift-out design** for complete removal
- **No special tools** required beyond basic screwdriver

## Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Power Down System

!!! danger "Safety First"
    **Always power down and disconnect** all cables before panel removal.

1. **Shut down operating system** properly
2. **Turn off power supply** switch
3. **Disconnect power cable** from wall outlet
4. **Wait 30 seconds** for capacitors to discharge

### Step 2: Remove Securing Screw

![Lid Screw Location](../../assets/lid-screw-location.png)

1. **Locate the lid screw** on the rear edge of the chassis
2. **Use Phillips head screwdriver** to remove screw
3. **Turn counterclockwise** until screw is completely out
4. **Store screw safely** for reassembly

!!! tip "Screw Storage"
    Use a magnetic parts tray or tape the screw to the screwdriver to prevent loss.

### Step 3: Slide the Lid Backward

1. **Place hands on rear corners** of the lid
2. **Push lid backward** approximately 1 inch (25mm)
3. **Feel for the release point** where lid can lift
4. **Ensure smooth sliding** - do not force

### Step 4: Lift and Remove

![Lid Lifting Process](../../assets/lid-lift-process.png)

1. **Lift rear edge first** to disengage front clips
2. **Continue lifting evenly** across the width
3. **Pull lid straight up** once clear of chassis
4. **Set aside in safe location** away from work area

## Reassembly Process

### Lid Installation

1. **Align lid with chassis** ensuring proper orientation
2. **Lower lid onto chassis** with rear edge slightly elevated
3. **Slide lid forward** until it contacts front stops
4. **Press down gently** to ensure full seating
5. **Reinstall securing screw** and tighten snugly

### Verification Steps

- ✅ **Lid sits flush** with chassis body
- ✅ **No gaps** around perimeter
- ✅ **Screw tightened** to proper torque
- ✅ **No interference** with cables or components

## Safety Considerations

### Personal Safety

- **Clear workspace** of obstructions
- **Stable chassis position** on firm surface  
- **Adequate lighting** for visibility
- **Support lid weight** properly (approximately 3-4 lbs)

### Component Protection

!!! warning "Cable Awareness"
    Check that no cables will be pinched or stressed during lid removal or installation.

- **Inspect cable routing** before panel movement
- **Ensure sufficient slack** in all connections
- **Avoid contact** with exposed PCBs or connectors
- **Handle lid carefully** to prevent dropping

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Lid won't slide** | Misalignment or debris | Check rails for obstruction |
| **Binding during removal** | Forced movement | Reset and try gentle pressure |
| **Gaps after installation** | Improper seating | Remove and reinstall carefully |
| **Screw won't tighten** | Cross-threading | Back out and restart threading |

### Maintenance Tips

- **Monthly**: Check screw tightness
- **Quarterly**: Clean slide rails of dust/debris
- **Annually**: Inspect lid alignment and hardware
- **As needed**: Apply light lubricant to slide mechanism

## Tool Requirements

### Basic Tools
- **Phillips head screwdriver** (magnetic tip recommended)
- **Clean cloth** for handling
- **Good lighting source**

### Optional Tools
- **Magnetic parts tray** for screw storage
- **Anti-static wrist strap** if handling components
- **Flashlight** for inspection

## Best Practices

### During Removal
1. **Work deliberately** - no rushing
2. **Support lid weight** throughout process
3. **Keep track** of removed hardware
4. **Document** cable positions if needed

### During Service
1. **Place lid** in secure location
2. **Cover open chassis** if work will take time
3. **Avoid placing objects** on top of open system
4. **Take photos** of complex connections before disconnecting

### During Reinstallation
1. **Inspect all connections** before closing
2. **Ensure proper cable routing** 
3. **Test lid movement** before final screw installation
4. **Verify system function** after reassembly
