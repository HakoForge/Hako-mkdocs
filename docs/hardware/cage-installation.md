# Cage Installation

## Overview
Drive cages provide the mechanical interface between storage devices and the Hako-Core chassis. They enable hot-swappable operation and ensure proper alignment with PCB connectors.

The Hako-Core supports multiple cage types to accommodate different storage configurations. Each cage is designed for specific drive formats and mounting requirements.
