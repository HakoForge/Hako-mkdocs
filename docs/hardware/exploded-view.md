## Component Identification

The HakoCore 4U Server Chassis consists of 9 main components that assemble together to form the complete chassis system.

### Primary Components

| Item | Component Name | Function | Assembly Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **1** | PSU Bracket | Mounts ATX power supply | Rear-mounted, supports up to 200mm PSU |
| **2** | PCIe I/O Bracket | Motherboard I/O support | Aligns with motherboard rear panel |
| **3** | Chassis Body | Main structure housing | Contains all internal components |
| **4** | Chassis Lid | Removable access panel | Slide-and-lift mechanism |
| **5** | Rear Cage Bracket | Supports rear drive cages | Modular mounting system |
| **6** | Middle Cage Bracket | Supports middle drive cages | Optional fan mounting |
| **7** | Top Front Fan Bracket | Upper front fan mounting | Supports 3x 120mm fans |
| **8** | Bottom Front Fan Bracket | Lower front fan mounting | Intake configuration |
| **9** | Front Panel | Magnetic access panel | Tool-free removal |

- **Service accessibility** without complete disassembly
- **Upgrade path** for future expansion
- **Maintenance efficiency** with removable components

## Assembly Sequence

### Recommended Installation Order

1. **Install PSU Bracket** and mount power supply
2. **Mount motherboard** with PCIe I/O Bracket support
3. **Install Rear/Middle Cage Brackets** as needed
4. **Mount Fan Brackets** for cooling configuration
5. **Install drive cages** and PCBs
6. **Complete cable routing** and connections
7. **Install Front Panel** and Chassis Lid
8. **Final testing** and verification

### Tools Required

- **Phillips head screwdriver** (magnetic tip recommended)
- **Cable ties** for management
- **Anti-static wrist strap** (optional but recommended)
- **Flashlight or headlamp** for visibility

## Maintenance Considerations

### Regular Inspection Points

- **Mounting screws** - Check tightness quarterly
- **Cable routing** - Verify no stress or pinching
- **Air gaps** - Ensure adequate component spacing
- **Panel alignment** - Verify proper fit and sealing

### Service Access

Each component is designed for:
- **Tool-free or minimal-tool** removal
- **Clear access** to connections and mounting points
- **Safe handling** with appropriate grip surfaces
- **Component protection** during service
