## Component Identification

The HakoCore chassis consists of nine main components that work together to provide a robust storage platform.

### Component List

| Item | Component Name | Function | Material |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **1** | PSU Bracket | Secures ATX power supply | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **2** | PCIe I/O Bracket | Motherboard rear I/O support | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **3** | Chassis Body | Main structural frame | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **4** | Chassis Lid | Removable top access panel | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **5** | Rear Cage Bracket | Back row drive cage mounting | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **6** | Middle Cage Bracket | Center row drive cage mounting | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **7** | Top Front Fan Bracket | Upper front fan mounting | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **8** | Bottom Front Fan Bracket | Lower front fan mounting | Powder-coated aluminum |
| **9** | Front Panel | Magnetic access panel | Powder-coated aluminum |

## Assembly Relationships

### Primary Structure
- **Chassis Body (3)** forms the foundation
- **Chassis Lid (4)** provides top access
- **Front Panel (9)** offers magnetic front access

### Internal Framework
- **Cage Brackets (5 & 6)** mount perpendicular to chassis body
- **Fan Brackets (7 & 8)** integrate with cage brackets
- **PSU Bracket (1)** secures to rear of chassis
- **PCIe I/O Bracket (2)** supports motherboard mounting

## Design Philosophy

### Modular Construction
Each component is designed for:
- **Independent removal** for maintenance
- **Flexible configuration** based on needs
- **Tool-free or minimal-tool access**
- **Robust mechanical connections**

### Airflow Integration
The component layout promotes optimal airflow:
- **Front intake** through fan brackets and front panel
- **Rear exhaust** past drive cages and out the back
- **Unobstructed paths** through cage bracket design

## Assembly Sequence

### Recommended Order

1. **Chassis preparation**
   - Inspect chassis body for damage
   - Verify all mounting hardware

2. **Internal framework**
   - Install cage brackets
   - Mount fan brackets
   - Install PSU bracket

3. **Access panels**
   - Test fit chassis lid
   - Attach front panel magnets

4. **Component installation**
   - Mount PCBs and cages
   - Install power supply
   - Connect wiring harnesses

## Material and Finish

### Construction Material
- **Primary material**: Aluminum alloy
- **Thickness**: Optimized for strength-to-weight ratio
- **Joining method**: Precision welding and mechanical fasteners

### Surface Treatment
- **Finish**: Powder coating
- **Color**: Standard black (custom colors available)
- **Properties**: Scratch-resistant, corrosion-resistant
- **Texture**: Smooth finish for easy cleaning

## Maintenance Access

### Removable Components
All major components can be removed for:
- **Deep cleaning** of chassis interior
- **Component replacement** if needed
- **Modification** for custom configurations
- **Inspection** of structural integrity

### Service Points
- **Quick-release mechanisms** where possible
- **Standard hardware** for easy sourcing
- **Clear component labeling** for identification
- **Service documentation** for each component
