These metal flanges are used to secure the Hako-Core to a server rack's frame.

!!! info "Left and Right Server Rack Ears"
    Notice the rack frame holes are along the bottom part of the rack ears. Use this feature to distinguish between left and right rack ears.

!!! warning "Supporting The Chassis In A Server Rack"
    The rack ears alone are **not enough** to hold the chassis in a server rack. Server rails must be used. Rack ears are only to prevent the chassis from sliding out of the rack.
