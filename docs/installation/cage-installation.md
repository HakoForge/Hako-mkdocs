# Cage Installation

## Overview
Drive cages provide the mechanical interface between storage devices and the HakoCore chassis. They enable hot-swappable operation and ensure proper alignment with PCB connectors.

The HakoCore supports multiple cage types to accommodate different storage configurations. Each cage is designed for specific drive formats and mounting requirements.

### Cage Types

| Cage Type | Drive Format | Capacity | Hot-Swap | Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **12-SSD Cage** | 2.5" SSD/HDD | 12 drives | Yes | High-density SSD arrays |
| **4-HDD Cage** | 3.5" HDD | 4 drives | Yes | Traditional bulk storage |
| **Mixed Cage** | 2.5" + 3.5" | 2+2 drives | Yes | Hybrid configurations |

### Key Features

- Tool-free installation using thumb screws
- Keyed alignment prevents incorrect mounting
- Hot-swap carriers for individual drive access
- Airflow channels for optimal cooling

### Installing the Drive Cage

!!! danger "Safety First"
    It is always recommended to power down the system when working inside the case.

1. Power down the system completely
2. Remove chassis lid following panel removal procedure
3. Identify target mounting bracket (rear or middle)
4. Orient cage correctly - connectors toward PCB
5. Align cage tabs with bracket mounting slots
6. Slide cage into position against the bracket
7. Ensure flush contact across all mounting points
8. Install the thumb screws through cage tabs into cage bracket and tighten snugly.

This procedure works for all 3 cage types (SSD, HDD, Mixed)
